        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Redesign the online banking experience to reduce customer support calls by 30% and improve user satisfaction scores. The existing platform had a 45% task completion rate and users were frustrated with basic banking tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="overview-box">
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          Led end-to-end design process including user research (15 interviews, 200+ survey responses), competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. Established design patterns that became part of the company's design system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="overview-box">
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Increased task completion rate to 89%, reduced support calls by 42%, and improved customer satisfaction scores by 40%. The new design system components are now used across 12 banking products serving 2M+ customers.

    <!-- Content Section 1: Challenge -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The existing online banking platform was built incrementally over 15 years, resulting in a fragmented user experience with inconsistent patterns, confusing navigation, and outdated visual design. Customer support was overwhelmed with calls about basic tasks like transferring money or viewing statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our initial research revealed that users were abandoning simple tasks at alarming rates. The platform's information architecture didn't match users' mental models, and critical features were buried under multiple layers of navigation.
      </p>

      </figure>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 2: Research -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted a comprehensive research phase to understand user needs, pain points, and expectations. This included in-depth interviews with 15 customers across different demographics, a survey of 200+ users, and analysis of customer support tickets.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Research Findings</h3>
      <p>
        Users wanted three main things: quick access to account balances, easy money transfers, and clear transaction history. However, our analytics showed that completing these tasks required an average of 8 clicks and navigating through 4 different screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also discovered that users had severe trust issues with the platform. The outdated design made them question the security of their financial data, and unclear error messages left them unsure whether transactions had succeeded.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 3: Solution with side-by-side comparison -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Design Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Based on our research insights, we redesigned the entire platform around three core principles: clarity, efficiency, and trust. The new design consolidated the most common tasks into a streamlined dashboard and established clear visual hierarchy throughout the experience.
      </p>

      <!-- Side-by-side image comparison -->
      <div class="image-comparison">

          <figcaption class="image-caption">After: Clean design with clear information hierarchy</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3>Streamlined Navigation</h3>
      <p>
        We reduced the main navigation from 12 top-level items to 5 clearly labeled sections. Each section was organized based on user mental models discovered during our research, not the bank's internal organizational structure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 4: Full-width image showcase -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>The New Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        The redesigned dashboard puts the most important information front and center. Users can now see all their account balances at a glance, initiate transfers with 3 clicks instead of 8, and quickly access recent transactions.
      </p>

      <!-- Full-width image -->
      <figure class="content-image-full">
        <img src="../images/banking-dashboard-full.jpg" alt="Full view of the new banking dashboard design">
      </figure>

      <p>
        We introduced a card-based layout that could scale across devices and accommodate future features. Each card serves a specific user need identified during research, and the modular system allows users to customize their dashboard based on their preferences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 5: Design System -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Building a Design System</h2>
      <p>
        One of the key outcomes of this project was the creation of a comprehensive design system. We documented reusable components, patterns, and guidelines that ensure consistency across all banking products.
      </p>

      <!-- Regular content image -->
      <figure class="content-image">
        <img src="../images/banking-design-system.jpg" alt="Design system components showcase">
        <figcaption class="image-caption">Key components from the new design system</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The design system includes everything from basic UI components to complex transaction flows. It's now used by 6 product teams across the organization and has significantly reduced design and development time for new features.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 6: Testing & Iteration -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Testing & Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the design process, we conducted multiple rounds of usability testing. We tested low-fidelity wireframes with 8 participants, high-fidelity prototypes with 12 participants, and ran A/B tests on key features with 5,000 users in beta.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each round of testing revealed opportunities for improvement. For example, our initial transfer flow required users to select the account type before entering the amount, but testing showed that users wanted to enter the amount first. These small adjustments added up to a significantly better experience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 7: Results & Impact -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The redesigned platform launched in phases over 6 months. The results exceeded our initial goals and demonstrated the value of user-centered design:
      </p>

      <ul style="margin-left: var(--spacing-lg); margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);">
        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">Task completion rate increased from 45% to 89%</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">Customer support calls reduced by 42% (exceeding our 30% goal)</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">Customer satisfaction scores improved by 40%</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">Average time to complete a transfer decreased from 3 minutes to 45 seconds</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">Mobile usage increased by 65% as users gained confidence in the platform</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Perhaps most importantly, the design system we created has become the foundation for all digital banking products at the company. It's being used by teams building everything from business banking to investment platforms, ensuring a consistent experience for millions of customers.
      </p>

    <!-- Content Section 8: Learnings -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        This project reinforced several important lessons about designing for complex financial products. First, users judge the security of a platform partly by its visual design—a modern, polished interface builds trust. Second, what seems obvious to internal teams is often confusing to users; regular testing with real customers is essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, building a design system alongside product work requires extra effort upfront but pays dividends in the long run. The patterns we established are now saving teams months of work and ensuring consistent experiences across the entire product ecosystem.
